## Product Vision

### **Far Vision**
Adventra becomes the leading platform for adventure seekers worldwide, revolutionizing how people find like-minded 
partners for outdoor activities. Many individuals struggle to connect with others who share their passion for adventure, 
making it difficult to plan trips, find reliable companions, and ensure safety. Adventra solves this problem by offering 
a seamless, user-friendly experience similar to dating appsâ€”users can swipe left to pass, swipe right to connect, and chat 
with potential adventure partners.  Donâ€™t miss the opportunity to find like-minded people to embark on exciting adventures 
like hiking, boating, rafting, sky diving, skiing, and more.
### **Near Vision**
Develop and launch a functional prototype of Adventra that effectively connects users based on adventure preferences, skill 
levels, and geographic proximity. The initial release will include user profile creation, adventure-based matching, in-app 
messaging, and social media integration. The goal is to validate the core concept, gather user feedback, and iterate on features to improve engagement and usability.

## Initial Product Backlog
The initial product backlog is stored in our online project management tool.  
**Backlog URL:** https://6733team2.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/ADVNTR/boards/1/backlog

### **Backlog Items (PBIs)**
We have created over **10 user stories** for our product backlog. These stories are structured as follows:
- **Title:** Concise name of the backlog item
- **User Story:** "As a user, I want to action, so that benefit."
- **Additional Details:** Description of functionality, requirements, or acceptance criteria
- **Story Points Estimate:** Numeric estimation based on complexity

### **Ordered Backlog & Rationale**
Our backlog items are prioritized based on:
- Business value
- User impact
- Technical dependencies
- Development complexity

Explain the rationale behind your ordering process.

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is considered "Ready" if it meets the following criteria:

2. **User story** follows the proper format (As a user, I want to action, so that benefit).
3. **Additional details** are provided, including acceptance criteria.
4. **Story points** are estimated.

## Sprint Planning Readiness
We have estimated our PBIs using **story points**, starting from the top of the backlog to the bottom. The estimated backlog is stored in Jira/DevOps Azure and can be accessed via the following link:
