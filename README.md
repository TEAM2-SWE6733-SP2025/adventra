## Product Vision

### **Far Vision**
Adventra becomes the leading platform for adventure seekers worldwide, revolutionizing how people find like-minded partners for outdoor activities. The app incorporates AI-driven matching, predictive analytics for trip planning, and integrates with smart wearables to enhance safety and experience tracking. Over time, Adventra expands into a global adventure ecosystem, offering guided experiences, gear rentals, and partnerships with travel and outdoor brands.

### **Near Vision**
Develop and launch a functional prototype of Adventra that effectively connects users based on adventure preferences, skill levels, and geographic proximity. The initial release will include user profile creation, adventure-based matching, in-app messaging, and social media integration. The goal is to validate the core concept, gather user feedback, and iterate on features to improve engagement and usability.

### **Backlog Items (PBIs)**

- **User Story:** "As a user, I want to action, so that benefit."
- **Additional Details:** Description of functionality, requirements, or acceptance criteria

Our backlog items are prioritized based on:

3. **Additional details** are provided, including acceptance criteria.
4. **Story points** are estimated.
